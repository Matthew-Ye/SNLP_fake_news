# SNLP_FakeNewsDetection

This is the project of SNLP course. We implement the fake news detection based on several machine learning algorithms and compare their results. The project is based on the fake news challenge [FakeChallenge.org](http://fakenewschallenge.org).

This repository contains code that reads the dataset, extracts some simple features, trains a cross-validated model and performs an evaluation on a hold-out set of data. The results are also saved.
